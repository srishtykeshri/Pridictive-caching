# Predicitive-Caching
Overview
This project focuses on predictive caching techniques aimed at optimizing data retrieval and reducing latency in data-intensive applications. By predicting frequently accessed data, we can proactively cache it closer to the end-users or within edge servers, improving response times and enhancing user experience.

Features

->Predictive Model: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict cacheable content.

->Dynamic Caching: Automatically updates the cache based on real-time usage patterns.

->Evaluation Metrics: Includes metrics to assess cache hit ratio, latency reduction, and overall system efficiency.


Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python

Machine Learning Framework: TensorFlow 

Database: Redis 

Other Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, etc.
